While I was creating this script to solve a issue that I had to organize my download folder I did changes at the structure of the watchdog package, only getting the folder src of it, to allow users install the script without the neccessity to download the full package of watchdog, because when we are transfering script from one machine to another we can not have internet access to download folders or package.
