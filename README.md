# Download Organizer

<p>At majority of the time when we are navigating through Internet we download a lot of stuff and consequently we fill up our Download folder with a lot of things like music, pictures, videos and so on. Because of it I decided to put the hands on it and try to give a solution to this huge problem that I also have. </p>

<h2>Script propose</h2>
<p>Track the Downloads folder of your computer and put every file in the correct folder.</p>

<h2>What Do I need to get It?</h2>
You need to have Python installed.

<h2>How Install it at your computer?</h2>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Download the Package.</li>
  <li>Unpack the Package.</li>
  <li>Enter to your terminal and go to the folder <strong>Linux</strong> inside de package.</li>
  <li>Run those commands:

        chmod +x install.sh
        sudo ./install.sh
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How Uninstall it at your computer?</h2>
<strong>Linux</strong>

Run this command in your terminal: `sudo download_organizer uninstall`.

### How Can I stop the script while it's already running?
<strong>Linux</strong>

Run this command in your terminal: `sudo download_organizer stop`.

### How Can I run the script while it's stopped?

Run this command in your terminal: `sudo download_organizer start`.

<p>What about mac Os and Windows?</p>
<p>I'm still studying how can implement this on those operating systems.</p>
